  안녕하세요. **경험하고 공감하는 개발자** 최다정입니다.
  
  발전해가는 많은 기술을 다양한 사람들이 유용하게 사용하는 세상을 만들고자 개발자를 꿈꾸게 되었습니다.
  
  공감하는 Back-end 개발자로서, 항상 사용자의 입장에서 생각하고 그들의 편의를 위한 기술을 만들기 위해 노력하겠습니다.
  
  웹 서비스 개발 회사에서 Back-End, Front-End의 역할을 모두 담당하는 웹 개발자로 근무한 경험이 있습니다.
  
  이 경험을 바탕으로 JAVA를 이용한 개발 능력과 Linux 서버 및 Oracle, MySQL 등 다양한 DB 개발 능력을 기를 수 있었습니다.
  
  또한, 커뮤니케이션을 좋아하여 상대방의 의도를 신속히 파악하고, 제 의견을 조리 있게 주장하는 것에 자신이 있습니다.
  
  I am most skilled in: <mark>AWS</mark> and <mark>Eating Pizza</mark>

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
